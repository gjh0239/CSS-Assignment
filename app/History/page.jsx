				<p><b>History of Tic-Tac-Toe</b></p>
				<p>Its origins can be traced to ancient Egypt, where similar games involving arranging marks on a grid have been found on temple walls.
					The earliest documented version of tic-tac-toe as we know it today can be traced back to the Roman Empire, where it was played on wooden boards with wooden pieces.
					It became particularly well-known in Europe during the Renaissance period, where it was played on paper with pen and ink.
				</p>

				<p><b>Where did the name come from?</b></p>
				<p>
					The early Roman version was known as terni lapilli, or three pebbles at a time. In the mid-1800s,
					Britain used the name noughts and crosses, with nought referring to the Oâ€™s (or zeros) used in the game.
					The United States officially adopted the name tic tac toe in the 20th century.

				<p><b>History of Snake</b></p>
				<p>One of the earliest versions of the game was developed by Gremlin Industries in 1976 and was titled "Blockade."
					Blockade was a two-player game where each player controlled a snake-like creature that grew longer as it moved.
					The goal was to outmaneuver the opponent and avoid crashing into walls or the opponent's snake.
					The game gained widespread popularity in the late 1990s when it was pre-installed on Nokia mobile phones,
					particularly the Nokia 6110, released in 1997.
